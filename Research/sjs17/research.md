### Research 9/10 - 9/17:
	* Watched the University of Toronto's PSY 230h Personality and its Transformations lecture on the Big Five personality model to gauge how personality dimensions manifest themselves and how idiosyncrasies between individuals contribute to the success vs. failure of relationships.
	* Developed a condition of orthogonality between individuals with two dimensions that are so disjoint (i.e. 95th percentile in Openness to Experience vs. 5th percentile in Openness to Experience) to attenuate dissonance between two people so deviant in one score.
	* Developed a standard error value that we employ after the preliminary personality test to compensate for imprecision in the indicator test users take upon sign-up.

### Research 9/17 - 9:24:
	* Women are about a standard deviation higher in Agreeableness and Extroverison.
	* After puberty, women become higher in Neuroticism than men and tend to stay there for the rest of their life.
