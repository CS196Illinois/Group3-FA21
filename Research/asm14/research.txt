Databases —> collection of related info

Databases are in table form with keys to identify each branch —> uses query to retrieve data

SQL databases are tables with fixed tables and rows (relational)

NoSQL has dynamic columns (horizontal scaling) but also can have data collection with graphs (nodes/edges) and JSON documents
 SQL Types —> Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL
NoSQL Types —> MongoDB and Couch DB and Amazon Neptune

NoSQL has flexible data models and fast queries

SQL write/read speed faster with larger data collection, NoSQL opposite with faster production




ACID Transactions --> NoSQL not supported

Atomicity; A transaction is an atomic unit of processing, should be performed in entirety or not at all

Consistency preservation; Transaction should be executed from beginning to end without interference

Isolation; Transaction should be executed in a manner isolated from other transactions

Durability - Changes applied to database should not become lost 



CAP Theorem -> For distributed databases, cannot provide more than two of the following

Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error

Availability - Every request receives the most recent write or an error

Partition tolerance - System continues to operate despite number of messages being dropped
